# DB-Exercises
This is an Excercise to get to get to know with DB Connections in Python. I had to do this assignment as a part of my course "Advanced Python Programming" on https://maktabkhooneh.org


Write a program that takes email and password as input and stores it in a database called username and password. Only submit your code file. The written code must be able to enter information as input and store and record information in an arbitrary database file.
It is necessary to follow the email format as input. If the input format is not an email format, show the user the correct instance and retrieve the input from the user. Password also includes number and string.
The correct email pattern is one that contains two strings and an expression (including strings or numbers and strings at the same time) by @ and. Separated, is considered as the correct email. As follows:
expression@string.string
